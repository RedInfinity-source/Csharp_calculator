# Csharp_calculator
This is officially starting to use the C++ compiler or processor. The idea of the project is to build a functional form application for a beginner position.
This calculator, however, needs more debugging and the addition of more mathematical buttons or functions.

plains:
  - add more math functions
  - build a better use for the function buttons. (If you click on a function button, the project automatically solves the problem without the user adding additional information to the final answer.)
Â  - possible add letters to the calculator
  
how to use this code:
  - press a number
  - use one of the symbol functions
  - press another number
    - you can use a function key to solve the number with the function. for exaple log(7) -> 0.84509804001425683071221625859264
